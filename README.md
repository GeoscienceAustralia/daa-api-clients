# SpacePrez Explorer

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that act as clients of [SpacePrez](https://github.com/surroundaustralia/Prez/) APIs.

SpacePrez APIs implement both [OGC API](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/) and [Linked Data API](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) standards for the delivery of spatial data on the Web. 


## Particular APIs

The particular targets of these client Notebooks are a series of SpacePrez APIS that have been build for [Geoscience Australia](https://www.ga.gov.au)'s [Digital Atlas](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/national-location-information/digital-atlas-of-australia) project. The data that these APIs deliver was originally delivered online in forms similar to SpacePrez for the [Location Index (LocI)](http://ga.gov.au/locationindex) project which ran from 2018 - 2020.

The targeted APIs are:

1. [Australian Statistical Geographies Standard (ASGS) 2021]() - _coming!_
2. [Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) v3]() - _coming!_
3. [Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF)]() - _coming!_
4. [FSDF Datasets]() - _coming!_


## Client Aims

These Notebooks are aimed at two things:

1. replicating the functionality of the LocI _Explorer_ and _IderDown_ clients
    * (see http://loci.cat/#datasets-and-applications)
2. acting as general-purpose, configurable (scriptable) SpacePrez clients 
    * to demonstrate how interactions with SpacePRez APIs can occur
    * to be configured for specific tasks


# Use

These Notebooks can be run locally, if you have a Jupyter Notebooks setup on your desktop, or they can be run online using:

XXXXXXX

To run locally, you will need a [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) environment established and then to run the Jupyter server.
